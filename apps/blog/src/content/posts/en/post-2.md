### My Tech Stack - The Good, Bad & the Forced

### The Framework Game
Look, there's a bunch of solid SSR frameworks out there - Remix, Angular, Nuxt... and yeah, the OG NextJS. My old app? NextJS 14 all the way.

### The "Lazy" Upgrade
Being the lazy dev I am, I thought "why rewrite when you can codemod?" So I just upgraded to v15. I mean, Vercel already had me in their ecosystem (kinda like how Apple gets ya), so might as well go all in, right?

### The Monorepo Madness
And that's how I ended up with this absolute unit of a monorepo - got my app, custom api, and somehow this blog got dragged into it too. Not my proudest moment ngl ðŸ˜…

### The React 19 Pain Train
Oh boy, React 19... don't even get me started. The whole React ecosystem is still stuck on v18 and here I am, living dangerously. My solution? Just used the `--force` flag that dependency tree like a caveman. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Kinda proud, i finished it in a week.
