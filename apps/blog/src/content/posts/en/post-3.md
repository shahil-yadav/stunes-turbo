### An Important Note Regarding Piracy

### Disclaimer
I want to make it clear that this project was created solely to explore and demonstrate technical architectural concepts. It was never intended to promote or enable piracy in any form.

### Acknowledgment
I must acknowledge the talented artists who create the music we enjoy. Your work deserves fair compensation and proper attribution. This project was meant to highlight technical implementations, not to undermine your rights.

I ain't the one out there first, checkout this btw https://blackholemusicapp.com 

### Moving Forward
Thank you for understanding that this was purely an academic exercise in software architecture. I encourage everyone to support artists through legitimate streaming platforms and music purchases.
