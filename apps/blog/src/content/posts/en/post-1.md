### What Motivated Me To Build This? (Spoiler: Procrastination)

So picture this - there I was, supposed to be studying for prelims. But instead? Scrolling through ig reels like a zombie and vibing to Spotify. Classic. So I thought maybe I can use my overthinkin to do something good basically

### The "Productive" Overthinking
Then my brain did that thing where it's like "hey, remember that old app? Let's mess with that" And being the professional procrastinator I am, I went "yeah seems legit"

### The Real Story
Look, I just like breaking stuff and putting it back together. So here we are - me building this thing instead of preparing for exams. At least I'm coding... right?
